  <h3>What is Sales Management Software?</h3>hr<br/>

                   
               <p>Sales management software is designed to help companies to combine their sales procedures and tasks, starting with leads and quotes and moving to conversions, along with reports and quality evaluation. This product can collect vital sales info in a short amount of time and you don’t have to spend hours doing the same work by hand on a spreadsheet.</p><br/>

                   
               
               
               </div>
               
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-7">
                   
                   
                   <p> You can also calculate key variables such as conversion rates, win-loss ratio, and lead time. Sales management software can give you a detailed picture of your sales team’s work on different products, services, locations, and customers. This solution can accelerate the tracking of your sales flow to help you achieve your targets faster. To help you select a suitable sales management app, we have prepared detailed reviews of the popular platforms in this category, and we advise you to check Brightpearl which is our current leader.</p><br/>
                   
                   
                   <h3>The evolution of sales management software</h3>hr<br/>
                    <p>The traditional sales database was just a list of names and contact details, with products and meetings loosely attached, if you were lucky. Unwieldy, inflexible and tricky to navigate, those databases contained a lot of information. But much of it wasn’t what you really needed to know.</p> <br/>
                    <p>For a really productive customer relationship, you need to fill in all the gaps: social profiles, online activity, connections with other members of their networks, and all those other vital details that just wouldn’t fit in an old-style customer software package.</p><br/>
                    <p>But at last, a new generation of sales management tools has caught up with how sales actually works. The ability to focus on customers has seen the boundaries between sales management and customer relationship management (CRM) blurring and in some cases disappearing altogether.</p>

                   <br/> <h3>Why sales CRM matters</h3>hr<br/>
                    <p>Customers are no longer just customers – they’re connections. A sales strategy now has to link up with social networks, devices and data. On the high street, for instance, global research consultancy Forrester estimates that by 2018 connected retail - shopping with a social, search or web research element - will influence 44% of European transactions. </p><br/>
                    <p>That’s not unique to consumer sales; business-to-business is also well on its way to becoming a mobile, intelligent network which runs 24 hours a day and can be handled seamlessly in Beijing, Brussels or Birmingham. The days of nine-to-five, office-bound paper-and-pencil transactions are long behind us, replaced by vast volumes of data stored in the cloud, with a suite of tools to make sense of it all and give you the ability to see a customer relationship from all angles.</p><br/>

                    <p>An old-style customer database, often not much more than an address book nailed to a transaction list, simply isn’t equipped to handle the amount of information that can now be used to help connect with a customer and turn a one-off sale into a fruitful, long-running relationship.</p><br/>
                    <p>That’s where real sales CRM comes in; offering a 360-degree view of a customer’s sales history and interactions, social likes and dislikes, wider networks and connections. The end result is a customer-first relationship, where marketing and sales are oriented towards the buyer. You’re not selling at them, you’re co-operating with them intelligently – while also turning sales leads into solid contracts.<p>
